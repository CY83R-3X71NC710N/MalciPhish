## What is MalciPhish?
MalciPhish is a Python project which involves machine-learning to identify and flag malicious emails using a collection of phishing email samples. It also has the capability to make predictions on future emails. MalciPhish is a portmanteau of the words "malicious" and "phishing".

## Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* NLTK
* Sci-kit Learn
* Flask
* SMTP Library

## Goals
* Create a machine-learning model to accurately identify and flag malicious emails
* Use a collection of phishing email samples to train the model
* Make predictions on future emails
* Utilize open source and closed source APIs
* Create a prototype for corporations and individuals to contribute to

## Roadmap
1. Collect a dataset of phishing email samples
2. Preprocess the data and create a machine-learning model
3. Test the model on the dataset
4. Create a prototype for the project
5. Integrate open source and closed source APIs
6. Make predictions on future emails
7. Refine the model

## What Makes MalciPhish Unique?
MalciPhish is unique in its ability to accurately identify and flag malicious emails using machine-learning. It is also able to make predictions on future emails, and utilizes both open source and closed source APIs. Additionally, MalciPhish is designed to be a prototype for corporations and individuals to contribute to.

## Note
This is a work in progress and is currently a prototype. It should be built off and extended to become more powerful. The URLs and possible keys used in this prototype may need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine. Additionally, any closed-source APIs used are a work in progress and likely will not be released to the public due to licensing agreements, so someone should create an open source alternative.
